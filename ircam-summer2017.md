# IRCAM Residency — Summer 2017

## Goals

- [ ] Extend `AbstractMusicalModel`
- [ ] Extend graphical representations of `ScoreModel`
- [ ] Implement interactivity (Antescofo, page-turning, etc)

---
  
## Schedule
  
## Thursday, June 1 — Sunday, June 11: Starting up
- [x] Verify state of full stack: `AbstractMusicalModel` -> `ScoreModel` -> `ScoreViewModel`
- [x] Implement basic geometrical / algebraic algorithms / structures for graphics

## Monday, June 12 — Sunday, June 18: Rhythm
- [ ] Create score model with arbitrary measures
- [ ] Flow a score representation with arbitrary measures
- [ ] Deploy basic staff representation in score representation context
- [ ] Implement Rhythm representation
